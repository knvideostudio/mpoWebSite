                        this article describes how to create a profile in LinkedIn professional network.</h2>

            <tr>
				<td class="sml" style="width: 900px; text-align: left; vertical-align: middle; height : 35px;" >In today's world, where almost everything is in digital format, a person must have a presence on the internet. I encourage everyone to create their own web site. You also need profiles in Facebook, Twitter and Linkedin.
LinkedIn is one of the largest professional networking web sites. You can create a profile that includes your work history and skill set. Once you enter your employment history the web site will automatically try to find the company names and will display a list of people who are already registered. 
                    <br />
                    It is a good idea to have a small professional photo of yourself. Once your profile is ready, you will need to invite people to join your “Network” which is similar to FaceBook's "Invite A Friend."
The people who joined your network will show up in the section called "Connections." You will be able to send them messages. 
                    <br />
                    Also, ask some of them to recommend you. I am not going to explain to you how the entire website functions, however, you can explore more in depth on your own. In this article I will highlight a few features which I think are important. The following image shows what a profile looks like once you completed the registration and filled all details. 
                    <br />
                    <img alt="Kn Profile" class="style1" src="img3/knprofile.jpg" /><br />
                    <br />
 The web site tracks who views your profile as well as how many times your name comes up in searches. Your profile must be completed before it is published. Once you have published your profile in Linkedin, it is online and can be viewed by others. 
It is very important to understand that this profile will be indexed quickly by the Search Engines, BOTs, and Spiders, so be careful that what you write is what you intend to publish because once it is online, the information will be distributed throughout the web. Though your profile may change, or be edited, the profile first published may persist on the web for a while.
Linkedin also has a selection of paid plans with different features. Take a look at the features below. The Basic plan is free, but it has limitations on how many invitations or messages you can send. There are three different plans Business, Business Plus, and Executive. You may pay per month or per year.
                   <br />  <br />In the photo bellow you may see how many people actualy view you profile and 
                    search for you, showing the search result.

                    <img alt="Search Result" class="style2" src="img3/manyviews.jpg" /><br />
                    <h3>Creating you own Group</h3>

                    <img src="img3/iceskate.jpg" alt="" />
                    <br />
                     Another interesting feature is that you can join different groups where you can post messages and connect with more people. If you like, you can create your own group and ask your connections to join the group. 
For example, you may choose to join the Atlanta Buckhead Connections Group, write your own message, and connect with them to expand your network. The Atlanta Buckhead Connections Group also meets locally, so you will also have the advantage of meeting some of these people in person. Usually, there is a small fee from $20 to $30 per person to attend most of these meetings.
This is one example of how you can network to create your own group, meet more people and even make a profit. </p>
<p>
    Another important thing to be aware of are scams. A person doesn't need to be an 
    expert to identify them. For instance, be careful if someone asks you for money 
    and promises you a huge profit in a short amount of time. I like to be positive 
    and optimistic, but sometimes you must discern between reality and 
    &quot;get-rich-quick&quot; scams. Here is a great example of a scam I found in a 
    networking meeting. I found a flyer advertising that a great inventor was 
    working on a toy to be sold in the major retail market. The individual had a 
    huge idea but lacked the money to fund his project. He needed someone to invest 
    $1,000 in his idea to help make his dream come true. In return, he would pay 
    back, in installments, a sum of $20,000 to the first 20 investors willing to 
    help him with his idea. The most dangerous part of the scam is when people such 
    as the one mentioned above, target people from a more emotional level . . .</p>
