        <span class="tl1">Main Post Office Toastmasters Club Provides You with These Benefits.</span>	
		<br /><br />
		1. Toastmasters is a unique means of learning and improving your 
		communicative abilities within an atmosphere of fellowship and fun with 
		your fellow club members. <br>
		2. You have unlimited opportunities for personal and occupational 
		advancement based on improved abilities and expanded experiences.<br />
		3. You gain experience in leadership development through training and 
		involvement.<br />
		4. You receive professionally prepared educational materials and 
		resources on speaking, listening, discussion , parliamentary procedures, 
		audio-visual techniques and conference and meeting procedures.<br />
		5. You receive The Toastmaster Magazine every month. The Toastmaster 
		provides new insight on communication techniques, ideas and opinions.
		<br />
		6. You experience increased confidence, ability to organize logical 
		thoughts and present them self-assuredly, and a better understanding of 
		human relations.<br />
		7. A personal couch is assigned to you to help you through your first 
		six months of membership. <br />
		8. Membership includes affiliation with one the top clubs in District 
		14.<br />
		<br />
		<strong>Your responsibilities As a Main Post Office Toastmaster Member<br />
		</strong><br>
		1. Assist fellow members in developing their communication and 
		leadership abilities as you develop our own.<br />
		2. Contribute as a Toastmasters team member. We are consistently one of 
		the best clubs in the district because of the activities of our members. 
		An organization can do great things when all members pull together as a 
		team. We ask that you accept committee assignments, make suggestions and 
		consider becoming an officer to help our club continue its high standard 
		of excellence. <br />
		3. Share your Toastmasters experience by telling others about the 
		program, bring them to meeting and inviting them to join. <br />
		4. Attend meetings. You cannot gain anything from us, nor can we benefit 
		from you, unless you attend meetings. We encourage your attendance at 
		all meetings even when you are not scheduled on the program.<br>
		5. Perform your scheduled assignments. The Toastmaster’s motto is “We 
		learn by doing”. If you don’t fulfill your assignment, you do not learn, 
		and you disrupt the program. If you are not able to perform as assigned, 
		notify the Toastmaster on the program about the change. Should you plan 
		to absent for a period of time, advise the Vice-President of Education 
		so your name can be omitted from the schedule.<br />
		6. Do your best. Not one in Toastmasters is expected to be perfect. We 
		are learning and improving. It is important that you prepare for each 
		assignment. You will benefit from Toastmasters in direct proportion to 
		the amount of effort you put forth.<br />
		7. Dress in a manner that is consistent with the professional 
		environment of our club.<br />
		8. Adhere to the norms of good taste. No material should be presented 
		that could be offensive to some our members. When in doubt, as your 
		coach or the VP of Education.<br />
		9. Have Fun!!!!! Our meetings are fun. The founder of Toastmasters, Dr 
		Ralph Smedley, has said, “We learn best in times of enjoyment.” We 
		agree. Our meetings are upbeat and our members are optimistic. We ask 
		you to contribute to our positive meeting atmosphere.
